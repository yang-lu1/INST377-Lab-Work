<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to draw <em>attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
<p> you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.
<br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
