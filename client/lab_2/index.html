Let's Try Some Inline Elements

Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.

Empty Elements

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.
